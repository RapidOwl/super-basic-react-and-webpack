# Super Basic React & Webpack

## What is it?

A starter setup for building React apps with Webpack. This is intended for learning React and doesn't even come close to being useful for a production site.

## How do I use it?

* Run `npm install` to install all of the things that make this work.

Then...

* Run `webpack` to build your site.

Or

* Run `webpack-dev-server --open` to host your site locally with hot module reloading.

I've included examples of both class-based and functional components.

## Caveats

If the above commands error, you can try installing Webpack and Webpack Dev Server globally because it may not be in your path.

To do this:

* Run `npm install webpack webpack-dev-server -g`
